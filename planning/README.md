# Planning & Set Based Design

## Gantt Chart

We began our design and planning process by starting off with a quick Gantt Chart in order to split up our semester into sections and allot enough time for every aspect of our project. A lot of time was allocated towards project planning and set-based design. As the semester progressed, more time is alloted to fabrication, iteration, and software implementation. The four phases were split up into *Planning/Research*, *Design*, *Fabrication*, and *Testing/Demo*.

## Set A Design

We started off our set-based design by doing a mind map activity centered on three spectrums: *Niche* to *Universal* application, *Realistic* to *Impossible* implementation, and *Easy* to *Hard* fabrication. Our mind map contained a creative and diverse solution set, and assisted in understanding the physical bounds of our design. Some ideas ranged from *Roomba-esque* robots to focusing on a scanner that checked for ripeness. We also had the vending machine that we ultimately settled on as our product during this stage of concept generation.

## Set B Design

Given our expansive Mind Map from Set A, we shifted to a Morphology Chart in order to find more subtle and direct approaches to simple problems like *grabbing* or *scanning*. This type of concept generation allowed us to mix and match designs in order to come up with creative solutions. We split up our product priorities into *movement*, *scanning*, *grabbing*, *unobtrusiveness*, *collision detection*, *charge ability*, and *locating items*. This specification list has changed drastically throughout our design process, but initially we were hoping for our product to roam through the grocery store freely and assist customers.  

## Final Round of Design

After meeting with Bray Lab staff about our project, they noticed how broad our original problem statement was, and helped narrow our scope to something manageable given a one month fabrication and testing time period. We pivoted from an original problem statement that focused on the general automation of the grocery store to an in-aisle automation solution. After wrapping up this mind map, we came up with 5 individual solutions by mixing and matching the different entries from our various set-based design. The 5 individual designs and CAD models will be discussed in the [design section](https://github.com/drybell/Senior_Design/tree/master/design)
