# Page Layout
This repository is split up into two sections: code and team documents. The code exists in the root location, with JS, CSS, and images in `static` and HTML in `templates`. The code is split into multiple python scripts, along with a flask server app (within `app.py`). The `planning` and `presentations` folders contain seperate README files that explain the inner workings of each file, as well as how the team utilized each file when working on the project. 
## `planning` 
In this folder, there exists `.pdf` and original file-type versions of each document created during our planning phase. 
## `presentations`
Here lie `.pdf` versions of our presentations presented to our classmates, Amazon sponsors, and instructors
## `static`
This folder contains three subfolders: `css`, `js`, and `images` which are used within the server to host stylesheets, internal scripts, and images.
## `templates`
This holds various `html` files which the server renders
